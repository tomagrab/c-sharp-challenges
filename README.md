# C# Coding Challenges Practice

This repository is a collection of my practice implementations for common C# coding challenges. It serves as a space to improve my problem-solving and coding skills in C#.

## Motivation

The purpose of this project is to:

* Solidify my understanding of core C# concepts
* Develop proficiency in algorithms and data structures
* Practice solving typical interview-style coding problems
* Explore different approaches and optimizations

## Challenges Covered

* **String Manipulation:** Palindrome checks, reversing strings, anagram detection, etc.
* **Array/List Problems:** Finding duplicates, Two Sum problem, sorting algorithms.
* **Data Structures:** Linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.
* **Object-Oriented Programming:** Basic OOP exercises and design pattern exploration.
* **Common Challenges:** FizzBuzz, prime number calculations, Fibonacci sequence, and more.

## Usage

The code is organized into solution files for each challenge. Feel free to adapt and use it for your own coding practice.

## To Contribute

I welcome contributions and feedback! If you'd like to suggest new challenges, improvements, or alternative solutions, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
